# *Crypto Arbitrage - (m05_challenge_01A):*<br><br>

## **Description:**<br>
This project is designed to perform two tasks:
<br>
<br>
### ***Part 1:***<br>
Create a financial planner for emergencies. The members will be able to use this tool to visualize their current savings. The members can then determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund.<br>

This part is divided into three sub-components:<br>
1. Evaluate the Cryptocurrency wallet in the portfolio.
2. Evaluate the Stocks & Bonds in the portfolio.
3. Evaluate the emergency funds
<br>
<br>

### ***Part 2:***<br>
A financial planner for retirement. This tool will forecast the performance of their retirement portfolio in 30 years. To do this, the tool will make an Alpaca API call via the Alpaca SDK to get historical price data for use in Monte Carlo simulations.

<br>
We will also use the information from Monte Carlo simulation to answer questions about the portfolio.
